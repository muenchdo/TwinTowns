# Twin Towns
This is my ongoing project for the course [Algorithmic Design](http://www.ai.ar.tum.de/lehre/master/digitale-darstellungsmethoden/algorithmic-design/#c46) at the [Chair for Architecture Informatics](http://www.ai.ar.tum.de/en/homepage/) at [TU MÃ¼nchen](http://www.tum.de). 

The general idea is to interactively visualize the twin towns of german municipalities on a map. This is still at a very early, prototypical stage.
